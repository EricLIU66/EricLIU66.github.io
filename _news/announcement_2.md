12:43:50.636	‚ö°Ô∏è 
12:43:50.637	‚ö°Ô∏è 	The following routes were not configured to run with the Edge Runtime:
12:43:50.637	‚ö°Ô∏è 	  - /api/cors/[...path]
12:43:50.637	‚ö°Ô∏è 
12:43:50.637	‚ö°Ô∏è 	Please make sure that all your non-static routes export the following edge runtime route segment config:
